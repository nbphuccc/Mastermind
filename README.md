Mastermind is a game where there is a secret code of a random combination of balls chosen from 8 colors, and you must accuarately guess the color and placement of each ball.
On the right, you will recieve hints about your attempts.

A Red Ball means there is a ball of the corrent color in the correct position. It does not specified what color is accurate and in which position is it accurate!
A White Ball means there is a ball of the correct color, but in the wrong position.

You have 10 attempts to uncover the secret code.

I made this as a final project for my first ever CS class (I immigrated in June and took the class in September 2022. It has been a great jpurney looking back, and I hope better things still are ahead). Because of that, the codebase is not very well written, as I have not even leanred about how to do Object based programing.
Nevertheless, it is 100% function. That is always my aim.
